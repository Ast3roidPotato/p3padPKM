**Reading Response 9**  

Read Sections 4.1 & 4.2 from your text and respond to following prompts.  

1.  After reading the second to last paragraph on page 178 (starting ``This theorem is a better..."), do you agree or disagree with the following statement: ``It is normal (and even helpful) to make mistakes in mathematics, particularly when it helps me investigate why a solution works." Why?

I agree with it in theory, and for other subjects this I think that statement holds true for me, but it doesn't really work for me in this class yet because I haven't internalized the material yet.


2.  After reading the proof of Theorem 4.2.5, do you have any unanswered questions about any of the logical statements presented?

With the new topic, I need some more time for it to sink in. So yes, but they aren't formed properly yet.



3.  (_Optional_) What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?


**Reading Response 10**
  
Read Sections 4.3 and 4.4 and respond to the following prompts.

1.  In Section 4.3, the text introduced a way to visualize relations. Was this helpful? Are there ways we could visualize other concepts covered in this course?

	The visualizations made sense, but only would be helpful if the relations get to be large and complicated enough that it's unwieldly to write them out.

2.  Give an example of a partial order on a set A (not from the book). Does it have a minimal element? If so, what is it?



3.  (_Optional_) What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

**Reading Response 11**

Read Section 4.5 and respond to the following prompts:

1.  Give an example of an equivalence relation that is not from the book.



2.  After reading the proof of Theorem 4.5.4, consider the following questions. Was is helpful to prove the Lemma outside of the Theorem to simplify the proof? Were you able to understand the proof better? Why is this Theorem an important result?



3.  _(Optional)_ What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

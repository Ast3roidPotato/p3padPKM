RR12. Read ∮ 5.1 and ∮ 5.2.  
1. In ∮ 5.1, the book describes functions as a relation with an added restriction. Have you  
seen functions described this way? Does it help you better understand what a function  
is?  

I've seen a similar description for continuous continuous functions, where they have to pass the vertical line test, where at any given position of a vertical line, there is only 1 point of intersection between the vertical line and the graph of a function. And yes, it does help specify what a functions is.

2. In your own words, describe what it means for a function to be one-to-one, onto and  
bijective.  

One-to-one means that in function f mapping A to B, there is only one elemetn in a related to each element in b.

3. (Optional) What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

RR12. Read ∮ 5.1 and ∮ 5.2.  
1. In ∮ 5.1, the book describes functions as a relation with an added restriction. Have you  
seen functions described this way? Does it help you better understand what a function  
is?  

I've seen a similar description for continuous continuous functions, where they have to pass the vertical line test, where at any given position of a vertical line, there is only 1 point of intersection between the vertical line and the graph of a function. And yes, it does help specify what a functions is.

2. In your own words, describe what it means for a function to be one-to-one, onto and  
bijective.  

One-to-one means that in function f mapping A to B, there is at most one element in a related to each element in b.

onto means  that every element in B is being pointed to be at least 1 element of a.

Bijective means that every element in A is mapped to an element in B and every element in B is mapped to by an element in A.

3. (Optional) What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

Read Sections 5.3 & 5.4 and respond to the following prompts:

1.  In Section 5.3, the book proves Theorem 5.3.4 by proving a circle of implications. What about the statement of the Theorem allows us to structure our proof this way? Do you understand this type of proof?

I understand the principle of it, and reminds of 

2.  In your own words, what is the difference between a set being closed and the closure of a set?

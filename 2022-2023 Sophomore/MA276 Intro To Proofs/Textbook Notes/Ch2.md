**Reading Response 4:**

1.  Write a sentence that uses either a universal quantifier or an existential quantifier. Identify which one, then analyze the logical form of the sentence.

There exists carbon-14 in samples of dead organisms. This is an existential qualifier as the sentence states says that some C_14 exists in dead organisms. It can be expressed as. $\exists x \,C(x)$ where $C(x)$ is $[x]>0$ (concentration of c14 is greater than zero)

2.  What did you find was the most important point or technique from Section 2.2.

The quantifier negation laws seemed particularly helpful. The point in the textbook about making equivalences easier to understand by re-framing them in positive terms makes sense.


3.  What was your muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

In the same vain as my answer to point 2, my muddiest point is some of the examples for the quantifier negation laws. I need more practice with them to get familiar - most of the material hasn't sunk in well so far yet.

## 2.1

$\forall$ is called the *universal quantifier* 

$\forall P(x)$ means that P(x) is true for every value of x in the universe, means that the truth set for P(x) is the same as the universe U.

$\exists x\,P(x)$ means that there is at least one value of x in the universe for which P(x) is true. The previous expression reads: "There exists an x such that P(x)" This is an *existential quantifier*.

1.  What did you find to be the most important point or technique from Section 2.3?  

Being perfectly honest, I was very confused about 2.3 and don't really know what's important. I'll go over the material again after 

2.  What did you think of the analogy between proofs and jigsaw puzzles? Can you think of any other appropriate analogies? What were your take-aways (if any) from this?  

I the analogy was very good and made sense. My main take away was that there is no one good way to approach a problem, but there are many bad ways to approach a problem.

3.  What was your muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

My muddiest point was 2.3 starting with:
$A = \{x_i \mid i \in I\}$ can be defined as $A = \{ 
x \mid \exists i \in I(x = x_i)\}$


## 2.3 More Operations On Sets

S is the set of all perfect squares: $S = \{n^2\mid n \in \mathbb{N}\}$

Indices for an index family don't have to be numbers. With S being the set of all students and $m_s$ being the mother of s, for any student s, the set of all mothers of students could be written  $M = \{m_s \mid s \in S\}$.


Any indexed family $A = \{x_i \mid i \in I\}$ can be defined as $A = \{ 
x \mid \exists i \in I(x = x_i)\}$


Sets can be elements of other sets.

<u>Definition 2.3.2:</u>

> Suppose A is a set. the *power set* of A, denoted $\mathcal{P}(A)$, is the set whose elements are all the subsets of A. In other words,
> $$\mathcal{p}(A) = \{x \min  \subseteq A\}$$

$\forall$ is called the *universal quantifier* 

$\forall P(x)$ means that P(x) is true for every value of x in the universe, means that the truth set for P(x) is the same as the universe U.

$\exists x\,P(x)$ means that there is at least one value of x in the universe for which P(x) is true. The previous expression reads: "There exists an x such that P(x)" This is an *existential quantifier*.

**Reading Response 2**

Read Section 1.1, 1.2, & 1.5 from your text and respond to the following prompts.

1.  Give an example of a valid deductive argument (not from the textbook).

One deductive argument is: If water is below 0 centigrade at STP, it will be frozen. There is water below 0 centigrade at STP, therefore it is frozen.

2.  Give an example of an invalid deductive argument (not from the textbook). Why is this invalid?


I will either eat pizza or potatoes today.
I will either drink water with pizza, or milk with salad.
Therefore, I will drink milk with salad or eat potatoes.

3.  What did you find was the most important point or technique from Section 1.2?
The compact way of writing truth tables was interesting, but probably isn't something I'll do yet, as I feel it could get confusing. The most important part from section 1.2 was page 21 which detailed 

4.  In your own words, what is the difference between a conditional and biconditional statement?


5.  What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?


  **Reading Response 3**
Read Sections 1.3 & 1.4 from your text and respond to following prompts.

1.  What did you find was the most important point or technique from Section 1.3?
2.  When reading the proof of Theorem 1.4.7, why is the conclusion $(A\cup B)\backslash B = A$ incorrect? What is imprecise about this reasoning?
3.  What was your muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

# Ch1: Deductive Reasoning and Logical Connectives

Deductive reasoning is getting to a conclusion based on the assumption that some statements called *premises* are true. 

### Sentential Logic

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: |
| $\vee$ | OR |
| $\wedge$ | AND |
|$\neg$ | NOT |

### Example 1.1.2

1. Either John went to the store, or we're out of eggs.
		S $\vee$ eggs
2. Joe is going to leave home and not come back.

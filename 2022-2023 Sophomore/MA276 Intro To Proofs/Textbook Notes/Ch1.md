1.  Give an example of a valid deductive argument (not from the textbook).

One deductive argument is: If water is below 0 centigrade at STP, it will be frozen.

There is water below 0 centrigrade at STP, therefore it is frozen.

3.  Give an example of an invalid deductive argument (not from the textbook). Why is this invalid?
4.  What did you find was the most important point or technique from Section 1.2?
5.  In your own words, what is the difference between a conditional and biconditional statement?
6.  What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

3.  What was your muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

# Ch1: Deductive Reasoning and Logical Connectives

Deductive reasoning is getting to a conclusion based on the assumption that some statements called *premises* are true. 

### Sentential Logic

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: |
| $\vee$ | OR |
| $\wedge$ | AND |
|$\neg$ | NOT |

### Example 1.1.2

**Reading Response 6**

Read Sections 3.2 & 3.3 from your text and respond to following prompts.

1.  On page 104, the book asks "How could we be sure, when we reached a contradiction, that the culprit was the third givenÂ x=3x=3?". In your own words, summarize the books response to this question. Does this make sense or do we still have questions? (_This is such a fundamental proof technique that I want to make sure we really understand the underlying machinery here._)  



The third given had to be the culprit, because it was the only given in our new setup that wasn't in the initial list of assumptions. That seems to make sense.

2.  What is the difference between existential instantiation and universal instantiation? How do we see this difference manifest in proofs?  

Existential instantiation introduces a new variable that makes P(x) true, while universal instantiation says P(x) is true for all x.  The difference shows itself when you see something that you can apply existential instantiation to, you do it immediately and give that variable a new name. However, for universal instantiation, you need a specific value to plug in, so one would wait until a later point when a specific value makes sense to use.
   
3.  What was your muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

The proofs at the end of 3.3 that made use of instantiation were a bit confusing.


# Chapter 3

It's generally easier to prove a positive statement than a negative one, so it's usually easier to express a proof in the form of $\neg P$ before proving it.

A way of solving a proof, is instead to use something you know shold be false in the givens and try to find a contradiction. This is **proof by contradiction** and is super important.


**Reading Response 7**

 Read $\oint 3.4$ \& $\oint 3.5$.

1.  In $\oint 3.4$, you likely noticed the amount of *Scratch Work* that the text did prior to writing up the final *Solution* to the problem. What is the purpose of the scratch work? Why is it so important to distinguish between the two?

The point of the scratch work is to reshape the givens and goals of the problem to be more  conducive to writing a proof. It is important to distinguish between the two so that the reader of the proof doesn't get distracted by same problem being expressed in different ways over and over again, and instead can just focus on the actual content of the proof.

2.  How does the disjunctive syllogism argument help us simplify and prove statements involving $\lor$? Did we see this logical equivalence used earlier in class?

It states that $[(P\lor Q)\land \neg P] \to Q$, and allows you know that the other side of the disjunction is true if you are given,. or prove that one of the sides is false.

3.  What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions? 

These topics made sense - I don't have any unanswered questions.

## 3.4

Treat biconditionals as two separate givens; $(P \leftrightarrow Q \equiv (P \to Q)\land(Q \to P))$  then prove each of the givens separately.

## 3.5 - Proofs involving disjunctions
For proving $P \lor Q$,  you know that either P, or Q must be true.

One method of approaching these proofs is to assume P, then try to prove the goal, the assume Q and try to prove the goal. You don't know which assumption is correct, but at least one of them has to be. The two possibilities are called *cases*. When cases cover all of the possibilities, they are considered *exhaustive.*  Proofs can be broken up into cases as long as the cases are exhaustive. 



**Reading Response 8**
Read Sections 3.6 & 3.7 from your text and respond to following prompts.


1.  In your own words, what is an existence and uniqueness proof?

An existence and uniqueness proof is a proof that shows that there is only one valid value in a universe that satisfies a proposition.

2.  One the first day of class we "proved" Theorem 3.7.2 (omitting some details). After reading through the books proof, do you feel you understand the argument better? Have you noticed any growth in your ability to read and understand proofs that are presented to you?






3.  (_Optional_) What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

## 3.6 - Existence and Uniqueness Proofs



## 3.7 - More Examples of Proofs

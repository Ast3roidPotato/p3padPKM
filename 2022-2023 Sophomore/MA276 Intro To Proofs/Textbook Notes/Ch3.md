**Reading Response 6**

Read Sections 3.2 & 3.3 from your text and respond to following prompts.

1.  On page 104, the book asks "How could we be sure, when we reached a contradiction, that the culprit was the third givenÂ x=3x=3?". In your own words, summarize the books response to this question. Does this make sense or do we still have questions? (_This is such a fundamental proof technique that I want to make sure we really understand the underlying machinery here._)  



The third given had to be the culprit, because it was the only given in our new setup that wasn't in the initial list of assumptions. That seems to make sense.

2.  What is the difference between existential instantiation and universal instantiation? How do we see this difference manifest in proofs?  

Existential instantiation introduces a new variable that makes P(x) true, while universal instantiation says P(x) is true for all x. 
   
3.  What was your muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?




# Chapter 3

It's generally easier to prove a positive statement than a negative one, so it's usually easier to express a proof in the form of $\neg P$ before proving it.

A way of solving a proof, is instead to use something you know shold be false in the givens and try to find a contradiction. This is **proof by contradiction** and is super important.

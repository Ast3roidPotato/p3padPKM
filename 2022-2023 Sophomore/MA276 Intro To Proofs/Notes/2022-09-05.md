## Reading Example

> If I don't feed by cats, then my partner will. 
> I fed the cats, therefore, my partner did not.

This is an invalid argument because both people could have fed the cats.

$$(P\rightarrow Q)$$
$$\frac{\neg P}{Q}$$

In a conditional, Negative the if part doesn't let you conclude anything.

### Correction:
>Precisely one of my partner of I will feed the cats.
>I fed the cats.
>Therefore my partner did not.

## Laws of Logic
- Conditional Law: $P \rightarrow Q \equiv \neg P \vee Q$
- DeMorgans's Laws:
	- $\neg [P \vee Q] \equiv \neg P \wedge \neg Q$
	- $\neg [P \wedge Q] \equiv \neg P \vee \neg Q$
- Distributive Laws:
	- $P \wedge [Q \vee R] \equiv [P \wedge Q] \vee [P \wedge R]$
	- $P\vee [Q\wedge R] \equiv [P \vee Q]\wedge[P\vee R]$

- The brackets are *very* important when writing these laws!

>e.g:  $P \vee Q \wedge R \neq P \vee [Q \wedge R]$

When you mix and match OR's and AND's groupings matter.


<u>Definition:</u>
> Let P AND  be propositions. Given $P\rightarrow Q$, we have the following related statements:
> The contrapositive: $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$
> The converse: $Q \rightarrow P$
> The inverse: $\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q$

The most important one is the **contrapositive**, because they are logically equivalent: $P\rightarrow Q \equiv \neg Q\rightarrow \neg P$

### Steps to show equivalence: 
$$\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \equiv [\neg\neg]Q \vee \neg P\,
 \text{(By conditional law)}$$
$$\equiv Q\vee P\,\text{(double negation)}$$
$$\equiv \neg P\vee Q\,\text{(commutes)}$$
$$P \rightarrow Q\,\text{(by Conditional Law)}$$

### Important Notes:
The conditional is equivalent to the contrapositive
The converse is equivalent to the inverse, because the inverse is the contrapositive of the converse.

All 4 are equivalent if $P\rightarrow Q$ becomes $P \leftrightarrow Q$

The converse and the inverse truth values are independent of $P\rightarrow Q$

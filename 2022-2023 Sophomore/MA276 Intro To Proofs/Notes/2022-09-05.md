## Reading Example

> If I don't feed by cats, then my partner will. 
> I fed the cats, therefore, my partner did not.

This is an invalid argument because both people could have fed the cats.

$$(P\rightarrow Q)$$
$$\frac{\neg P}{Q}$$

In a conditional, Negative the if part doesn't let you conclude anything.

### Correction:
>Precisely one of my partner of I will feed the cats.
>I fed the cats.
>Therefore my partner did not.

## Laws of Logic

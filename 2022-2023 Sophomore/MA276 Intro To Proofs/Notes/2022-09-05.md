## Reading Example

> If I don't feed by cats, then my partner will. 
> I fed the cats, therefore, my partner did not.

This is an invalid argument because both people could have fed the cats.

$$(P\rightarrow Q)$$
$$\frac{\neg P}{Q}$$

In a conditional, Negative the if part doesn't let you conclude anything.

### Correction:
>Precisely one of my partner of I will feed the cats.
>I fed the cats.
>Therefore my partner did not.

## Laws of Logic
### Conditional Laws

Conditional Law: $P \rightarrow Q \equiv \neg P \vee Q$
DeMorgans's Laws:
	- $\neg [P \vee Q] \equiv \neg P \wedge \neg Q$
	- $\neg [P \wedge Q] \equiv \neg P \vee \neg Q$
Distributive Laws:
	- $P \wedge [Q \vee R] \equiv [P \wedge Q] \vee [P \wedge R]$
	- $P\vee [Q\wedge R] \equiv [P \vee Q]\wedge[P\vee R]$

The brackets are *very* important when writing these laws!
EX:
> $P \vee Q \wedge R \neq$

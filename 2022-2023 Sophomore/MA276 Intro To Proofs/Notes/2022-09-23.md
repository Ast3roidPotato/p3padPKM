## Existence and Uniqueness Proofs

There exists a unique element x in our universe of discourse $\mathcal{U}$ that satisfies $P(x)$

Or more formally:

$$\exists x \in \mathcal{U}[P(x) \land \forall y \in \mathcal{U}[P(y) \to y= x]]$$ 

Which is often abbreviated as:
$$\exists ! x \in \mathcal{U}[P(x)]$$

Where $\exists !$ means *precisely one*.

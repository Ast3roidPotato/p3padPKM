## Definition - Image

Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets and let $f:A \to B$.

For $C\subseteq A$, the image of $C$ over $f$ is the set of:
$$f(C) = \{f(x):x\in C\}$$

For $D\subseteq B$, the <u>preimage</u> of $D$ over $f$ is the set of:
$$f^{-1}(D) = \{a\in A: f(a)\in D\}$$

> Question: Is $f^{-1}$ guaranteed to be a function?
> Ans: No! Because $f$ is not one to one, and $f$ is not surjective


### Example:
Let $A= \{a,b,c,d,e,f\}$ and 
$B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$

Find the:
1. pre-image of {2}
2. the image of {c,d,e,f}
3. the pre-image of {3,4,6}
4. the image of A


Pre-Image of $\{2\}$ is $\{a,b\}$ because **that is where all of the arrows pointing to 2 come from.**

Image of $\{c,d,e,f\}$ is $\{4,5,6\}$ because **that is where all of the arrows point to**


## Theorem

Let $A$ be a nonempty set, and $f:A\to A$. 

For all $B \subseteq A$, the closure of $B$ under $f$ exists.

<u>proof</u>.
CASE1: $B=\emptyset$. Since $\emptyset$ is closed, its closure is itself.

CASE2: $B \neq \emptyset$ Let $\mathcal{K}\subseteq \mathcal{P}(A)$. Note that $\mathcal{K}$ is nonempty because at least $A\in\mathcal{K}$ Let $C = \bigcap \mathcal{K}$. We will show $C$ is the closure of $B$.

Let $b\in B$. Then $\forall X \in \mathcal{K}$, we know $b \in X$.

### Definition
Let $f:A\to B$. We say that $f:A\to B$ is *bijective* or $f$ is a *bijections* to mean that $f$ is injective and surjective.

> **Warning!** If $A$ and $B$ are <u>finite</u>, then $\exists$ bijection $f:A\to B$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ have the same number of elements.

If $A$ and $B$ are not finite, then stranger things happen. It is possible to have a bijection $f:A\to B$, where $A\subseteq B$ and $A\neq B$. $(A\subset B)$

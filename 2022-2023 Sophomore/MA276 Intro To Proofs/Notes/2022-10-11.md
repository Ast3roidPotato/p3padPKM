### Definition
Let $f:A\to B$. We say that $f:A\to B$ is *bijective* or $f$ is a *bijections* to mean that $f$ is injective and surjective.

> **Warning!** If $A$ and $B$ are <u>finite</u>, then $\exists$ bijection $f:A\to B$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ have the same number of elements.

If $A$ and $B$ are not finite, then stranger things happen. It is possible to have a bijection $f:A\to B$, where $A\subseteq B$ and $A\neq B$. $(A\subset B)$



#### Example
Let $A = \mathbb{R}\backslash{1}$ and let $f:A\to A$ be defined by $x\to \frac{x+1}{x-1}$. Prove that $f$ is a bijection.

<u>proof</u>. (Injective) Suppose $x,y \in A$ such that $f(x)=f(y)$. We want to show $x=y$. This means that $\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \frac{y+1}{y-1} \equiv (x+1)(y-1) = (x-1)(y+1)$ $\equiv y=x$

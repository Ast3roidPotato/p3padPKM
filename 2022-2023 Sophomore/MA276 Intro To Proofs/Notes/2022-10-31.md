### Strong Induction

The "base case" has been absorbed into the strong inductive hypothesis, In particular, the predicate $\forall K \in \mathbb{Z}^+[k<1\to P(k)]$ is vacuously true, so the strong inductive step implies $P(1)$ is true.


### Theorem
Every integer $n>1$ is divisible by a prime.

<u>proof</u>: Let $P(n)$ be the predicate "$n$ is divisible by a prime." Let $n>1$ be an integer. Suppose that for all integers <u>$k$ satisfying $1<k<n$ </u> we have $k$ is divisible by a prime (i.e. $P(k)$ is true). We want to show $P(n)$ is true.

- Case 1 n is a prime. Then $n\mid n$ so $n$ is divisible by a prime. So $P(n)$ is true.
- Case 2 $n$ is not a prime. Since $n>1, \exists a,b\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $a\neq1,\;b\neq1$. This means $a>1$ and $b>1.$ Suppose for contradiction $a\geq n.$ Then

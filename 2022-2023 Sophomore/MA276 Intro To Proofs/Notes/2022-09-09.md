## Continuing from last class

### Example Translations:
a. The sum of two non-zero integer squares is sometimes an integer squared.

$$\exists x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z^+} \cup \mathbb{Z^-} [x^2 + y^2 = z^2]$$
The $\exists$ is the translation for ***sometimes***.

b. If $A \cap B = \emptyset,\;\text{then} B\backslash A = B$

$$\neg \exists x (x \in A\land x \in B) \to \forall x ((x\in B \land \neg ( x \in A)) \leftrightarrow (x\in B)) $$

## Quantifier Negation Laws

$$\neg \exists x P(x) \equiv \forall x \neg P(x)$$
$$\text{There does not exist and x, so that P(x) is true}$$
$$\text{is equivalent to:}$$
$$\text{For all x, not P(x) is true.}$$
$$ $$

$$\neg \forall x P(x) \equiv \exists x \neg P(x)$$

<u>Note:</u>
Combining these laws with DeMorgan's Law and other logical equivalences, we are often able to:
(a) build more complex logical equivalences 
(b) Reframe a negative statements as equivalent positive statements

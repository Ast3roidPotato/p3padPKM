## Partial Order Definitions

Let $B\subseteq C$. We say that b is an R-smallest element of B to mean:
- *Formally:* $b\in B \land \forall x \in B[bRx]$
- *Informally:* b is an element of B and b is related t everything else in B


Let $B\subseteq C$. We say that b is an R-largest element of B to mean:
- *Formally:* $b\in B \land \forall x \in B[xRb]$
- *Informally:* b is an element of B and everything in B is related to b

> There is **only one** R-smallest or largest element of B.


### Example

Let $A = \{a,b,c,d,e,f\}, B=\{b,c,d\}, C = \{a,b,c\}$

**SET A** There is no R-smallest element and no R=largest element of A
**SET B** There is no R-smallest element, but d is the R-largest element of B
**SET C** The R-smallest element is a, and we have no R-largest element of C

### Observation:
A subset $B\subseteq A$ has an R-smallest element if and only if B has a unique R-minimal element. A subset $B\subseteq A$ has san R-largest element if and only if B has a unique R-maximal element.


### Example
Let $A= \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$ and let $R$ be the relation on $A$ defined by: $xRy$ means $x\mid y$. How many subsets of A have an R-smallest element.

> Break into cases!

Since $(1,x)\in R$ for all $x\in A$, any subset containing 1 will have 1 as the R-smallest element, so there are $2^9$ subsets.

What if 2 is the R-smallest element? Look at subsets of $\{2,4,6,8,10\}$ that contain 2.
There are $2^4$ subsets

What if 3 is the R-smallest element? $2^2 subsets$

What if 4 is the R-smallest element? $2 subsets$

What if 5 is the R-smallest element? $2 subsets$
for 6-10, any set that has 6-10 as an R-smallest element will only contain one element.
Therefore there is only 1 subset for each 6,7,8,9,10.

Total number of subsets with an R-smallest = 
$$2^9 + 2^4 + 2^4 + 2^2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +1 = 541$$

## Definition:

Let $B\subseteq A$. We say that $l$ is a **lower bound** for $B$ to mean:
- *Formally* $l \in A \land \forall x \in B[lRx]$
- *Informally* $l$ is an element of $A$ and $l$ is related to everything in B.

We say that $l$ is the **greatest lower bound** for B to mean: $l$ is the R-largest element of the set of lower bound for $B$.

Let $B\subseteq A$. We say that $u$ is a **upper bound** for $B$to mean:
- *Formally* $u \in A \land \forall x \in B[xRu]$
- *Informally* $u$ is an element of $A$ and everything in $B$ is related to $u$.

### Example
Let $A=\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}$

![[Drawing 2022-10-06 11.44.12.excalidraw|600]]

**SET B** 
Lower bounds of B are $\{c,a,b\}$

Greatest Lower Bound is $\{c\}$
Upper bounds of B: there are none

**SET C** 
Lower bounds of B are $\{a,b\}$

Greatest Lower Bound: There is none because we have no way of comparing $a$ and $b$.
Upper bounds of B: There are none because $f$ is not related to $d$ or $e$.

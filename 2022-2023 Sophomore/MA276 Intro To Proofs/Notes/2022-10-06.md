## Partial Order Definitions

Let $B\subseteq C$. We say that b is an R-smallest element of B to mean:
- *Formally:* $b\in B \land \forall x \in B[bRx]$
- *Informally:* b is an element of B and b is related t everything else in B


Let $B\subseteq C$. We say that b is an R-largest element of B to mean:
- *Formally:* $b\in B \land \forall x \in B[xRb]$
- *Informally:* b is an element of B and everything in B is related to b

> There is **only one** R-smallest or largest element of B.


### Example

Let $A = \{a,b,c,d,e,f\}, B=\{b,c,d\}, C = \{a,b,c\}$

**SET A** There is no R-smallest element and no R=largest element of A
**SET B** There is no R-smallest element, but d is the R-largest element of B
**SET C** The R-smallest element is a, and we have no R-largest element of C

### Observation:
A subset $B\subseteq A$ has san R-smallest element if and only if B has a unique R-minimal element. A subset $B\subseteq A$ has san R-largest element if and only if B has a unique R-maximal element.


### Example
Let $A= \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$ and let $R$ be the relation on $A$ defined by: $xRy$ means $x\mid y$. How many subsets of A have an R-smallest element.

> Break into cases!

Since $(1,x)\in R$ for all $x\in A$m aby subset containing 1 will have 1 as the R-smallest element.

There are $2^9$ subsets. 1 will be an element in half of them.

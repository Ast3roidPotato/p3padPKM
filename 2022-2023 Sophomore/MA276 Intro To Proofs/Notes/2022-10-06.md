## Partial Order Definitions

Let $B\subseteq C$. We say that b is an R=smallest element of B to mean:
- *Formally:* $b\in B \land \forall x \in B[bRx]$
- *Informally:* b is an element of B and b is related t everything else in B


### Example

Let $A = \{a,b,c,d,e,f\}, B=\{b,c,d\}, C = \{a,b,c\}$

**SET A** There is no R-smallest element and no R=largest element of A
**SET B** There is no R-smallest element, but d is the R-largest element of B
**SET C**

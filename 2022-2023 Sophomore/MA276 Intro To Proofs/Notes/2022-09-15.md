### Example continuing from previous

Proof: Suppose x and y are integers such that x and y are both off. This means that $\exists k,j \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $x=2k+1$ and $y=2j+1$. Then $x+y=(2k+1)+(2j+1) = 2k + 2j + 2 = 2(k+j+1)$. Let $n = k+j+1$. Note $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ Since $x+y = 2n$ so $x+y$ is even. $\blacksquare$

#### Note:
When writing a proof in paragraph form, $\exists k,j \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $x=2k+1$ and $y=2j+1$. this defines k,j,x,y for the entirety of the proof, unlike in a purely symbolic proof where the there exists needs to follow k,j for every equivalence.


### Indirect proof example:
Suppose $n$ is an integer. If $n^2$ is not even, then n is not even.

> Instead of proving this statement, we are going to prove the contrapositive

If $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even

<u>Proof:</u> Suppose n is an integer. We aim to prove the contrapositive of if $n^2$ is not even, then n is not even. Toward that end, assume n is even. This means that $\exists k \in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $n=2k$.

Then, $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$
Let $j=2k^2$, so $n^2 = 2j$.
Since $j\in\mathbb{Z}$, we know that n is even. $\blacksquare$


### More example:

Suppose $A\cap B \subseteq C\backslash D$
If $x\in A$, then if $x\in D$ then $x \notin B$

### Example continuing from previous

Proof: Suppose x and y are integers such that x and y are both off. This means that $\exists k,j \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $x=2k+1$ and $y=2j+1$. Then $x+y=(2k+1)+(2j+1) = 2k + 2j + 2 = 2(k+j+1)$. Let $n = k+j+1$. Note $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ Since $x+y = 2n$ so $x+y$ is even. $\blacksquare$

#### Note:
When writing a proof in paragraph form, $\exists k,j \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $x=2k+1$ and $y=2j+1$. this defines k,j,x,y for the entirey of the proof, unlike

## Sets

<u>Definition:</u>
> A <u>set</u> is a collection of stuff. The stuff inside the set are called <u>elements</u>

e.g. A = {1,2,3,{4,5}}

The elements are the numbers 1,2,3 and the set {4,5}.

It is *not* correct to say that 4 is an element of A.

### Notation:

$x\in X$ translates to "x is an element of X"

Some common sets:
- $\mathbb{N}$ = |N = natural numbers, = {0,1,2,3,...}
- $\mathbb{Z}$ = the integers = {..., -2, -1, 0 , 1 , 2 ,...}
- $\mathbb{Z}^+$ = the positive integers ={1,2,3,...}
- $\mathbb{Q}$ = the rational numbers = $\{\frac{a}{b}\; a\in \mathbb{Z}\; b \in \mathbb{Z}^+\}$
- $\mathbb{R}$= the real number
- $\mathbb{C}$ = the complex numbers

## Variable Proposition or predicate
<u>Definition:</u>
> A sentence with one or more free variables such that once those variables are declared, it becomes a proposition called a variable proposition or predicate.

e.g. $P(x)$ = "x divides 10"
is a 1-variable proposition/predicate

**NOTE:** Variavle prop/predicates are not propositions as they do not have a truth value.

### Set-Builder Notation
Left P(x) = "x divides 10"

$$\{ x\in \mathbb{N}:P(x)\} = \{ 1,2,5,10\}$$

**NOTE:** It is important to specify the universe of discourse because then the resulting set changes.

$$\{ x\in \mathbb{Z}:P(x)\} = \{-10,-5,-2,-1,1,2,5,10\}$$

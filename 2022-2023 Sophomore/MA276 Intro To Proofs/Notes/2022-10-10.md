### Definition
Let $A$ be a set. We saw that a family of sets $F\subseteq\mathcal{P}(A)$ is a <u>partition</u> of $A$ to mean:
1. $A = \bigcup F$
2. for all $X,Y \in F, X\cap Y \neq\emptyset$ implies $X=Y$.
	2. (equivalent) for all $X,Y \in F, X\neq Y$ implies $X\cap Y = \emptyset$ 


#### Question: 

is **2** equivalent to $\bigcap F = \emptyset$?

No, because 

$$2\not\to \bigcap F = \emptyset$$
$$\bigcap F = \emptyset \not\to 2$$

Statement 2 means that the sets in $F$ are *pairwise disjoint.*.

> $A/R$ is the set of equivalence classes.


### Theorem
$R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$ is and only if $A/R$ is a partition of A.


#### Example:
Let $L$ be the set of all nonvertical lines in the plan. Prove that $R = \{(k,l)\in L\times L \mid k \;\text{and}\; l\; \text{have the same slope}\}$. is an equivalence relation. Describe the equivalence classes.

<u>proof</u>. we need to show $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Let $k \in L.$ Since $k$ ha the same slope as itself, $(k,k) \in R$. Thus $R$ is reflexive. 

Suppose $(k,l) \in R$. This means $k$ and $l$ have the same slope. So $l$ and $k$ have the same slope. So $(l,k) \in R$. Thus $R$ is symmetric.

Suppose $(k,j),(j,l)\in R$. This means $k$ and $j$ have the same slope and $j$ and $l$ have the same slope. So $k$ and $l$ have the same slope. This means that $(k,l)\in R$. Thus, $R$ is transitive.

$[CX]_R$ is the equivalence class that represents all lines with slope C.

### Definition: Function
Left $f$ be a relation from $A$ to $B$. We call $f$ a *function* to mean that:
- *Formally:* $\forall A[\exists! b \in B[(a,b)\in f]]$
- *Informally:* for every element in the domain, there is exactly one arrow leading out from that element to the range

*Some comments on Notation:* If $(x,y)\in f$, then $y$ is uniquely determined by $x$, So we often write $y=f(x)$.

When $f$ is a function, we write $f:A\to B$.

This says $f$ is a relation from A to B that satisfies the above property.

#### Example:

Let $A = \{a,b,c,d\}$ and let $B = \{1,2,3\}$. Consider the following relations from $A$ to $B$. Which of these relations are functions? for the one(s) that e not functions, what property does it fail?

### Definition: Injective

- *Formally:* $\forall x,y \in A[f(x) = f(y) \to x=y]$
- *Informally:* for every element in the range, there is at most one arrow leading into it.

> The term *one-to-one* means the same thing as injective.


### Definition: Surjective
- *Formally:* $\forall y \in B, \exists x \in A[y = f(x)]$
- *Informally:* for every element in the range, there is at least one arrow leading into it.

> The term *onto* means the same thing as surjective.

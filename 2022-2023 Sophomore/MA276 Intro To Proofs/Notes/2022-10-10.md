### Definition
Let $A$ be a set. We saw that a family of sets $F\subseteq\mathcal{P}(A)$ is a <u>partition</u> of $A$ to mean:
1. $A = \bigcup F$
2. for all $X,Y \in F, X\cap Y \neq\emptyset$ implies $X=Y$.
	2. (equivalent) for all $X,Y \in F, X\neq Y$ implies $X\cap Y = \emptyset$ 


#### Question: 

is **2** equivalent to $\bigcap F = \emptyset$?

No, because 

$$2\not\to \bigcap F = \emptyset$$
$$\bigcap F = \emptyset \not\to 2$$

Statement 2 means that the sets in $F$ are *pairwise disjoint.*.

> $A/R$ is the set of equivalence classes.


### Theorem
$R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$ is and only if $A/R$ is a partition of A.


#### Example:
Let $L$ be the set of all nonvertical lines in the plan. Prove that $R = \{(k,l)\in L\times L \mid k \;\text{and}\; l\; \text{have the same slope}\}$. is an equivalence relation. Describe the equivalence classes.

<u>proof</u>. we need to show $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Let $k \in L.$ Since $k$ ha the same slope as itself, $(k,k) \in R$. Thus $R$ is reflexive. 

Suppose $(k,l) \in R$. This means $k$ and $l$ have the same slope. So $l$ and $k$ have the same slope. So $(l,k) \in R$. Thus $R$ is symmetric.

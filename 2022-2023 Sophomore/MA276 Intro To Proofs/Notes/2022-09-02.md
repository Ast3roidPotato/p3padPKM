## More Ch1
### Propositions
Definition:
> A **proposition** is a sentence that is either true or false

e.g.
"2 divides 6" is a proposition
"5 divides 1" is a proposition
$\frac{6}{2}$ is not a proposition
$\frac{6}{2} = 4$ is a proposition

Basically anything that can have a truthy evaluation is a proposition

### Connective Symbols
AND: $P\wedge Q$ means P and Q are both true
OR: $P\vee Q$ means that at least one or P or Q are true
XOR: $P\veebar Q$ means that precisely one of P or Q are true
Negation: $\neg P$ means the negation of P is true
Conditional: $P \rightarrow Q$ means if P is true, then Q is true
Biconditional: $P \leftrightarrow Q$ means P is true, if and only if (iff) Q is true.

#### In Class Example Table

| $P$ | $Q$ |  $P\wedge Q$  |  $P\vee Q$  | $P\veebar Q$  | $P \rightarrow Q$  |  $P \leftrightarrow Q$ |
|:---:| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **T** | **T** | T | T | F | T | T |
| **T** | **F** | F | T | T | F | F |
| **F** | **T** | F | T | T | T* | F |
| **F** | **F** | F | F | F | T* | T* |

Stared statements are **vacuously true statements** 

e.g. 
> P = "there are 30 hours in this day"
> Q = "today is Friday"
$P \rightarrow Q$ is *true*
$P \leftrightarrow Q$ is *false*

(There is nothing false because we started with an absurd premise)

### Logical Equivalence 

Definition:
> To Propositions are logically equivalent, denote $S_1 \equiv S_1$ or $S_1 \Leftrightarrow S_2$, is they have the same truth values for all choices of their primitive components

One of the most important ones is:
$$P \rightarrow Q \equiv \neg P\vee Q$$
"if P, then Q" $\equiv$ "at least one of $\neg$P or Q is true"

^^Prove this as an example with a *truth table*

### Tautology and Contradiction

Definition:
> A tautology is a compound proposition that is always true.
> A contradiction is a compound proposition that is always false.


Tautology: $P \vee \neg P$
Contradiction: $P \wedge \neg P$

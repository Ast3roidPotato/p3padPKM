## Intersections, Unions, Complements, Differences

![[Drawing 2022-09-08 11.01.11.excalidraw|1000]]

- Union: $A \cup B = \{x \in \mathcal{U}: x \in A\lor x \in B \}$
- Intersection: $A \cap B = \{x \in \mathcal{U}: x\in A \wedge x \in B \}$
- Compliment: $A^c = \{x\in \mathcal{U}: \neg(x\in A) \}$
- Set Difference: $A\mid B =  \{x\in\mathcal{U}: x \in A \wedge \neg (x\in B) \}$
- Symmetric Difference:  $A\Delta B = (A \in \mathcal{U}$
### Subset

<u>Definition:</u>
> Suppose A and B are sets. We say A is a ***subset*** of B, denoted $A\subseteq B$, if every element of A is also an element of B. We say A and B are ***disjoint*** if $A\cap B = \emptyset$ 


#### Example

Use logical symbols to sow $(A\backslash B)\backslash C = (A\backslash B) \cap (A\backslash C)$


proof: left $x \in (A \backslash B)\backslash C$. This is equivalent to $((x\in A \wedge \neg (x \in B)) \wedge \neg (x \in B)$. This is equivalent to $(x\in A) \wedge (\neg (x \in B) \wedge \neg (x \in C))$  by Associativity.  This is equivalent to $(x\in A\wedge \neg(x\in B)\wedge (x\in A\wedge \neg ( x \in C )))$ by distributive law. This is equivalent to $(x\in (A\backslash B)\cap (A\backslash C))$

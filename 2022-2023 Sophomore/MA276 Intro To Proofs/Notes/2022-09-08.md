## Intersections, Unions, Complements, Differences

![[Drawing 2022-09-08 11.01.11.excalidraw|1000]]

- Union: $A \cup B = \{x \in \mathcal{U}: x \in A\lor x \in B \}$
- Intersection: $A \cap B = \{x \in \mathcal{U}: x\in A \wedge x \in B \}$
- Compliment: $A^c = \{x\in \mathcal{U}: \neg(x\in A) \}$
- Set Difference: $A\mid B =  \{x\in\mathcal{U}: x \in A \wedge \neg (x\in B) \}$
- Symmetric Difference:  $A\Delta B = (x \in \mathcal{U}: x \in A \veebar x \in B$
### Subset

<u>Definition:</u>
> Suppose A and B are sets. We say A is a ***subset*** of B, denoted $A\subseteq B$, if every element of A is also an element of B. We say A and B are ***disjoint*** if $A\cap B = \emptyset$ 


#### Example

Use logical symbols to show $(A\backslash B)\backslash C = (A\backslash B) \cap (A\backslash C)$


proof: left $x \in (A \backslash B)\backslash C$. This is equivalent to $((x\in A \wedge \neg (x \in B)) \wedge \neg (x \in B)$. This is equivalent to $(x\in A) \wedge (\neg (x \in B) \wedge \neg (x \in C))$  by Associativity.  This is equivalent to $(x\in A\wedge \neg(x\in B)\wedge (x\in A\wedge \neg ( x \in C )))$ by distributive law. This is equivalent to $(x\in (A\backslash B)\cap (A\backslash C))$

## Ch2

<u>Notation:</u>
- $\forall$ is the universal quantifier because $\forall xP(x)$ reads: "for all x, P of x is true." $\forall$ means for all x in the universe of discourse.
- $\exists$ is the existential quantifier because $\exists xP(x)$ reads: "there exists and x such that P of x is true"

### Example:

Write the following sentence symbolical y using quantifiers.

a. All real solutions of the inequality $x^3 - 3x < 3$ are smaller than 10.

$$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}\; [x^3 - 3x < 3 \to x<10]$$

b. Anyone who has a roommate who has COVID will need to be tested.

## Proof Portfolio Info

Will include 8 proofs and a reflection. Is due before the final exam.

Start working on at one or two a week. Look through proofs that we've already done and mark ones that would meet the proof criteria. 

When assembling the portfolio, make sure that there is room to leave comments.

## Proof Portfolio Info

Will include 8 proofs and a reflection. Is due before the final exam.

Start working on at one or two a week. Look through proofs that we've already done and mark ones that would meet the proof criteria. 

When assembling the portfolio, make sure that there is room to leave comments.


## Set Relations
<u>Theorem:</u> Ler R be a relation on a non-empty se A. Then R is reflexive if and only if $\iota_A \subseteq R.$

<u>proof</u>: ($\to$) Supose R is reflexive. Let $x\in \iota_A$. Then $x= (y,y)$ for

## Proof Portfolio Info

Will include 8 proofs and a reflection. Is due before the final exam.

Start working on at one or two a week. Look through proofs that we've already done and mark ones that would meet the proof criteria. 

When assembling the portfolio, make sure that there is room to leave comments.


## Set Relations
### <u>Theorem:</u> 
Let R be a relation on a non-empty se A. Then R is reflexive if and only if $\iota_A \subseteq R.$

<u>proof</u>: ($\to$) Suppose R is reflexive. Let $x\in \iota_A$. Then $x= (y,y)$ for $y\in A.$ Since R is reflexive, $x= (y,y)\in R.$. Thus $\iota_A\subseteq R$.

($\leftarrow$) Suppose $\iota_A\subseteq R$. Let $a\in A$. We want to show $(a,a)\in R$. Since $(a,a)\in\iota_A$ and $\iota_A \subseteq R$, we know $(a,a)\in R$. So R is reflexive.

### <u>Theorem:</u> 
Let R be a relation on a non-empty set A. Then R is symmetric if and only if $R^-1 \subseteq R$.

<u>proof</u>: ($\to$) Suppose R is symmetric.  Let $z \in R^-1$. Then $z = (a,b)\in R^-1$. So $(b,a) \in R$. Since R is symmetric, $(a,b) \in R$. Thus $R^-1 \subseteq R$.

($\leftarrow$) Suppose $R^-1 \subseteq R$. Let $x = (c,d) \in R$. We knw that $(d,c) \in R^-1$. Since $R^-1 \subseteq R$ by assumption, $(d,c) \in R$. Thus R is symmetric.

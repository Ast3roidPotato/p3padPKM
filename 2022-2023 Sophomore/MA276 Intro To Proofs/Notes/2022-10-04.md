### Partial Order

**<u>Definition</u>** Let $R$ be a relation on $A$. We say that $R$ is a **partial order** if:
1. $R$ is reflexive
2. $R$ is transitive
3. $R$ is anti-symmetric

This means $\forall x,y \in A[xRy\land yRx \to x=y]$

More informally, the only way two elements can be related to each other is if they are the same.


If T is a partial order, we illustrate that relation with a <u>Hasse Diagram</u>

#### Rules for Hasse Diagrams
1. Only use Hasse Diagrams for partial orders
2. Don't draw loops because we know R is reflexive.
3. Two elements are related if they are connected via and <u>ascending</u> chain of edges. (So there are no arrows)
4. Since the relation is transitive, we do not draw any extra edges.

#### Min and Max elements

Minimal element/s are the root nodes of the tree. Maximal elements are the leaf nodes.

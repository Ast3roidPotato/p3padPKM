### Partial Order

**<u>Definition</u>** Let $R$ be a relation on $A$. We say that $R$ is a **partial order** if:
1. $R$ is reflexive
2. $R$ is transitive
3. $R$ is anti-symmetric

This means $\forall x,y \in A[xRy\land yRx \to x=y]$

More informally, the only way two elements can be related to each other is if they are the same.


If T is a partial order, we illustrate that relation with a <u>Hasse Diagram</u>

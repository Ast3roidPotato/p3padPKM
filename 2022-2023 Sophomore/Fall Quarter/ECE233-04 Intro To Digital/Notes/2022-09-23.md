## Look up shift-add multipliers at some point


## Look Up Carry Look-Ahead Adder

Carry look-ahead adders work on the principle of Generate and Propagate carries. Given input bits A and B, the *generate* output is high when the A + B will always carry regardless of the carry-in bit. So $A\land B \to \text{generate}$. Given input bits A and B, the *propagate* output is high when the carry result of A + B is dictated by the carry-in bit. So $A \veebar B \to \text{propagate}$.

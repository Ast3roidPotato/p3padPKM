## One-Hot State Machines

Up until now - we have been designing state machines using the minimum number of flip flops. **One-Hot** state machines instead have 1 flip flop per state.

The current state is defined by the flip-flop that contains a 1 (all other's must be zero)

The only reason for doing this is to confirm that a state diagram is correct.

One-Hot does not require a state table.

You just look at the state diagram and look at how you arrive at the state.

Mealy One-Hot vs Moore One-Hot
Mealy - output depends on the current state and the input
Moore is *just* current state.

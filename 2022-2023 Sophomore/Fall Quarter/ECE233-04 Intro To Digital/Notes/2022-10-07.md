## State Minimization and Counters

Write out $S_1,S_2...S_n$ for all of the states. Don't write the values for the encoding on the state diagram itself. Make a table that maps them to binary encodings.

### Unused States
with **n** flip flops, we have $2^n$ states.

 A spec may not require all of the states, so we have a choice:
 1. Consider those states **don't care** situations
	 - Simplifies the logic

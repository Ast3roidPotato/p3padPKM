### Some Terms:
- **Setup time:** $t_s$ The time the flip-flop must be stable before the triggering clock edge.
	- Changes to the flip-flip input during this time may not be reflected in the stored value
- **Hold Time:** $t_h$ The time the flip-flop must be stable after the triggering clock edge.
	- Changes to the flip-flip input during this time may not be reflected in the stored value
- **Minimum Clock Period:** $t_min$ is the smallest feasible clock period
	- $t_{min} = t_{pd} + t_{comb} + t_s$


### Critical Path
Is the ***longest*** path from a flip-flop output to a flip-flop input

### Slack
Is the difference between the actual clock period and the minimum clock period.

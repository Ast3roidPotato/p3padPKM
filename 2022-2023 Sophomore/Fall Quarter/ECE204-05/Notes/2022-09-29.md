## More Power Stuff

$$P = \frac{V_{RMS}}{R}$$


### <u> DC Circuit </u>
$V_{dc} = 10V$
$R = 5\Omega$
$$V_{avg} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T{v(t)dt}$$
$$V_{avg} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T{10dt}$$
$$V_{avg} = 10$$
RMS:
$$V_{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T{v^2(t)dt}}$$
$$V_{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T{100dt}}$$
$$V_{RMS} = 10$$
$$P=20\text{W}$$

### <u> AC Circuit </u>

$V_{m} = 10V$
$R = 5\Omega$

$$I_m = \frac{V_m}{R}=\frac{10}{5} = 2\text{A}$$
$$P = \frac{V_mI_m}{2}\cos(0)$$
$$P=10\text{W}$$

The powers are different!
That is where RMS comes in.

If $V_{RMS} = 10V$, the power is going to be the same as the equivalent DC circuit.

### Complex Power

$$S = P + jQ$$
Where $S$ is complex power. Units are VAR.

Complex power is not a phasor. It is shown as a vector, but isn't really.

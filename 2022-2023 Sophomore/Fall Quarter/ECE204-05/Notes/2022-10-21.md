<u>SINGLE-PHASE CIRCUIT</u>

When V = 150

The 150 is in RMS!!!!

<u>THREE-PHASE CIRCUIT</u>

When V=150
that is **line-to-line** and in RMS


## Instantaneous power in balanced three-phase systems

For a balanced three-phase load, the instantaneous power is equal to the sum of the individual powers, or:
$$p_T = p_A + p_B + p_C$$

this reduces to 
$$p_T = \frac{3}{2}V_mI_m \cos\theta$$

This shows that for a balanced three-phase system the total instantaneous power is time invariant.

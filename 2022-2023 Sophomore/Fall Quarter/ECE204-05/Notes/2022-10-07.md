### 3 Phase Power

Balanced 3-Phase - $Z_{load}$ and $Z_{line}$ for all three phases are equal.
Given that all three phases are 120 degrees apart - there will be no current through the ground path.

Given a balances 3 phase circuit, you only need to solve for phase a, then you shift b by -120 degrees, and phase b by -240 degrees and that is fine.

The phases a,b,c are in clockwise order.

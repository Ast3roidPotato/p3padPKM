## MPPT
For maximum average (real) power transfer:
$$Z_L = Z_{Th}^*$$


The imaginary current must cancel out:
$$R_L = R_{Th}$$
$$X_L = -X_{Th}$$

**IMPORANT!** $V_{Th}$ is in RMS, therefore $V$ is in RMS

$$P_{MAX} = \frac{|V_{Th}|^2}{4R_L}$$

In a single phase AC circuit. When a voltage valve is specified, it is the RMS value unless otherwise specified.

## Open Circuit Test

For this test, the transformer rated *voltage* and *frequency* is applied to the *low voltage* side of the transformer with the *high voltage* side open.

Power, voltage, and current are all measured on the low voltage side.

Since the high voltage side is open, the open circuit current *Ioc* is equal to the *exciting current* through the shunt excitation branch.

Because the exciting current is very small (2-5%) of the total current,

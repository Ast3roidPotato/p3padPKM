Important!

A 3 Phase system is a combination of 3 single phase systems.

Phase vs Line voltage is important.
- **Phase Voltage** is the voltage between Neutral and any line
- **Line Voltage** is the voltage between any 2 lines at any point along the line

In a Y-Y balanced circuit, the line voltage is $V_{\text{line}} = V_{\text{phase}}\sqrt{3}\angle30$ apart. I-Line = I-Phase

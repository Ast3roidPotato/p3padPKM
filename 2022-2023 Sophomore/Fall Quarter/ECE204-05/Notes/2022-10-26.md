## Important!
$$\frac{V^2}{R\;\text{or}\;X}$$

**Is only valid in PARALLEL CIRCUITS**

$$I^2\cdot(R\;\text{or}\;X)$$

**Is only valid in SERIES CIRCUITS**


## Mutual Inductance
$M$ is mutual inductance.

$L_1$ and $L_2$ are self-inductances.

Dots eliminate showing how the coils wrap around a core structure.

Dots allow us to draw the coils schematically and the rule is:
- When a current enters the dotted terminal of a coil, it induced a *positive* voltage in the other coil at the dotted terminal.

- When a current *leaves* the *dotted terminal* of a coil, it induces a *negative* voltage in the other coil at the *dotted terminal.*



$$M=L_1\frac{V2}{V1}$$
$k$ = coefficient of coupling - can be anywhere from zero to 1. 
$$k=\frac{M}{\sqrt{L_1L_2}}$$

## Lecture 3
### Sinusoidal Sources

$V_m$ is the notation used for the peak voltage of a waveform

Generally expresses in terms of COSINE function.

Basic Form:
$$v(t) = V_m \cos(\omega t)$$

Where:
$$V_m =\text{Peak Value}\,\,(V)$$
$$T = \text{Period}\,\,(s)$$
$$\omega = 2\pi f\,\, (rad/s)$$

General Form:

$$v(t) = V_m \cos(\omega t + \phi)$$

$\omega$ is going to be in radians. Without exception, degrees are used in electrical engineering. So you convert your to radians, punch into your calculator, then convert back to degrees.

$$\text{Degrees}  = \frac{180}{\pi}(\text{Radians})$$

### RMS

General Equation:
$$V_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{t_0}^{T+t_0}{v^2(t)dt}}$$

For a sinusoidal function:

$$V_{rms} = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}}$$

### Basic Waves Review

If $\phi$ is positive, the wave will get shifted to the left.

The new wave that has been phase shifted will *lead* the reference wave.

If $\phi$ is negative, the wave will be shifted to the right and it *lags* the reference waveform.

### Solutions

There is a transient and steady state solution component to every problem. This class ignores transience.

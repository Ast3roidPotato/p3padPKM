## Table of Reactance and Impedance
|<u>Circuit Element </u> | <u>Impedance</u>|<u>Resistance</u>  | <u>Reactance </u> |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|Resistor (R)|R|R| 0 |
|Inductor (L)| $j\omega L$| 0 |$\omega L$|
|Capacitor (C)|$\frac{-j}{\omega C}$| 0 | $\frac{-1}{\omega C}$|



## Frequency Domain of AC Circuits

Impedances are treated like resistors in series/parallel

### Note:
> Error in angles is not done in percent. It is done in just difference in degrees.

Read Sections 6.1 & 6.2 and respond to the following prompts:

1.  In Section 6.1, the book discusses proof by mathematical induction. In your own words, describe the proof technique. Why is it so important to have the base case?

The base case is important because it is the starting point that the rest of the proof builds off of. Once you prove the base case, you prove n+1 an 

2.  In Section 6.2, the books shows many theorems that can be proved by induction. Which proof surprised you the most? Why?

The proof about the grid squares was the most surprising because it doesn't seem like something that you would think of to prove with induction, or at all. Also the way of showing that those L shaped pieces can nest to cover the sub-grids was interesting and not something that I would have thought of.

3.  (_Optional_) What was the muddiest point? Do you have any unanswered questions?

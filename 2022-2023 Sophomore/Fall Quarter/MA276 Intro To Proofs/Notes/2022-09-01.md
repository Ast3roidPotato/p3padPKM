## Course Overview
![[D1]]
Use $\LaTeX$ for homework!!! YAY!

There are redraws allowed

>you are allowed to revise and resubmit up to three homework problems or reading responses per calendar week that earned a score of “Revise” or “Progressing”. This includes final exam week up until 5PM on Thursday, November 17. 

Revisions are due Sunday.
You can revise any previously done problem for a revision.
Revising the same problem twice uses two revisions.
<span style='color: orange;'>If you go from Revise -> Pass, then you can talk about not using a second revision.</span>

## Intro + Ch1
"What is a prime number?"

Typical answer: "a number that is divisible by 1 and itself."

Not specific enough? -> "a number that is *only* divisible by 1 and itself."

Still not specific enough? -> "a number that is *only* divisible by 1 and itself except 1 and 0"

What about negative numbers?

### Example proof
**Theorem:** There are infinitely many prime number.

pf. Suppose there are a finite number of primes.

If so, then we shold be able to write them down in a list.

$$p_1,p_2,p_3,...p_k$$
Let $N=p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 ... p_k + 1$. Note N is an integer and N > 1. N is not prime. So there is a prime number that divides N, say P. We also know that $p|p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 ... p_k$ (p is in the list) ->  $p|N-p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 ... p_k = 1$

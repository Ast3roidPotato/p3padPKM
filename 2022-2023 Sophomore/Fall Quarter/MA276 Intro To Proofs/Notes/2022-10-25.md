### Theorem:

For every positive integer $n\geq 4,\; 2^n \geq n^2.$

<u>proof</u>: Let $P(n)$ be the predicate $2n\geq n^2$.

BASE CASE: $n=4$. $2^4 = 16 = 4^2 \checkmark$ so $P(4)$ is true.

INDUCTIVE HYPOTHESIS:  Let $m\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $m\geq4$ and $P(m)$ is true. Show $P(m+1)$ is true.

$$2^{m+1} = 2 \cdot 2^m \geq 2m^2$$
$$P(m)\;\text{is true}$$
Since $m\geq 4,\;m^2\geq4m=2m+2m\geq2m+1.$
So $m^2 + m^2\geq2m+1 + m^2$

So $2m^2 \geq m^2+2m+1 = (m+1)^2$

Thus $2^{m+1}\geq(m+1)^2.$ So $P(m+1)$ is true. By induction, the result follows.

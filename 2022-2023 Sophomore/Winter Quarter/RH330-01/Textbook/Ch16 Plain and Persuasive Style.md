# Broad Definitions
Plain style - Plain style stresses clear wording and simple prose. It is most often used to instruct, teach, or present information. Plain style works best in documents like technical descriptions, instructions, and activity reports.

Persuasive style - There are times when you will need to influence people to accept your ideas and take action. In these situations, persuasive style allows you to add energy and vision to your writing and speaking. This style works best with proposals, letters, articles, public presentations, and some reports.

Grand style - Grand style stresses eloquence. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr., and President John F. Kennedy often used the grand style to move their listeners to do what was right, even if people were reluctant to do it.

# Plain Style
## Sentences
- Make the Subject of the Sentence What the Sentence Is About
- Use The “Doer” As the Subject of the Sentence
- Use a Verb to Express the Action, Or What the Doer Is Doing
- Put the Subject of the Sentence Early in the Sentence
- Eliminate Nominalizations

- Eliminate Excessive Prepositional Phrases
- Eliminate Redundancy in Sentences
- Write Sentences That Are “Breathing Length”
## Paragraphs
- Transition Sentence
- Topic Sentence
- Support Sentences
- Point Sentences
Aligning Sentence Subjects in a Paragraph - make sure that all of the sentences actually have same/similar subject.

### The Given/New Method
Another way to write plain paragraphs is to use the “given/new” method to weave sentences together. Every sentence in a paragraph should contain something the readers already know (the given) and something that the readers do not know (the new).

### Passive Voice
Passive voice does have a place in technical documents. A passive sentence is fine if:
- the readers do not need to know who or what is doing something in the sentence.
- the subject of the sentence is what the sentence is about.

# Persuasive Style

## Elevate the Tone
Tone is the resonance or pitch that the readers will “hear” as they read your document. Of course, most people read silently to themselves, but all readers have an inner voice that sounds out the words and sentences. By paying attention to tone, you can influence the readers’ inner voice in ways that persuade them to read the document with a specific emotion or attitude.

One easy way to elevate the tone in written texts is to first decide what emotion or attitude you want the readers to adopt. Then, use concept mapping to find words and phrases that evoke that emotion or attitude.

## Use Similes and Analogies
Similes and analogies are rhetorical devices that help writers define difficult concepts by comparing them to familiar things. For example, let’s say you are writing a brochure that describes an integrated circuit to people who know almost nothing about these devices.

## Use Metaphors
Though comparable to similes and analogies, metaphors work at a deeper level in a document. Specifically, metaphors are used to create or reinforce a particular perspective that you want readers to adopt toward your subject or ideas. For example, a popular metaphor in Western medicine is the “war on cancer.”

## Change the Pace
You can also control the reader’s pace as they move through your document. Longer sentences tend to slow down the reading pace, while shorter sentences tend to speed it up. By paying attention to the lengths of sentences, you can increase or decrease the intensity of your text.

# Wrapping Up
When you are drafting and revising a document for style, look for appropriate places to use plain and persuasive style. Minimally, a document should use plain style. Sentences should be clear and easy to read. Your readers should not have to struggle to figure out what a sentence or paragraph is about.

Persuasive style should be used to add energy and color. It should also be used in places in the document where readers are expected to make a decision or to take action. The use of tone, similes, analogies, and metaphors in strategic places should encourage readers to do what you want. You can use short or long sentences to adjust the intensity of your prose.

In the end, developing good style takes practice. At first, revising a document to make it plain and persuasive may seem difficult. Before long, though, you will start writing better sentences while drafting. You will have internalized the style guidelines presented in this chapter.

> Goes through the same Tuckman's Four Stages of Teaming we went over in MDS150

# Four Stages of Teaming
## Forming
- Planning stage
- Define the mission and goals/outcomes
- Figure out who does what - target strengths/niches
- Create a project calendar/workplan
- Discuss conflict resolution
> - acquaints 
> - formalities are observed
> - clarity roles
> - build goals
> - establish timelines 

## Storming
Teams figure out how to work together, usually through navigating conflict and tension together. Teams grow together and are better able to work towards achieving the goal after this.
### Run Effective Meetings
- Choose a meeting facilitator
- Set a meeting plan
- Be punctual!
- Have boxed off discussions for each agenda topic
- Encourage everyone to contribute
- Discover through debate
- Record decisions/discussions
- Leave time for a recap at the end
- Resolve conflicts using the methods discussed during the storming phase

## Norming 
Everyone starts to settle into their roles and accept their responsibilities. Criticism becomes received as constructive instead of adversarial.

### Revise Things!
- Take another look at the original plan - how is it working out? can it be improved based on IRL experience?
- Rethink team roles? Is anyone being under/over utilized?
### Virtual Work
Does not change the teaming strategies - just makes them more important since typical human interaction is removed.
- Stick to the plan stringently
- Communicate often
- Hold real time meetings with team members
- Build trust and respect through effective communication, high-quality work, and meeting deadlines.

## Performing
Teams enter the performing stage when everyone is completely comfortable in their roles and work fluidly together as a whole, anticipating each other's need and leaning on others in turn when needed.
- Have forms of quality feed back loops
	- Check on mission objectives
	- Conduct individual performance reviews.

## Threshold Concepts

Threshold concepts are concepts that are foundational to a field and essential to being competent in it. 


When marketing yourself, it is important to re-discover these foundations and make it clear to whoever you are marketing yourself to.  Don't assume that other people know you need basic skills. Hiring managers might not always know the details that are packed inside a "research internship" or similar umbrella term.

## Skills Inventory

In a cover letter, don't just restate your resume. Take an important thing on your resume, say internship, and expand on each of the points you said about the experience. With each paragraph linking the experience you had with something on the job requirements.

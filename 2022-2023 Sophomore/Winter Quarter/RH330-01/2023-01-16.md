## Style Review - Stakeholder Analysis

### Plain Style
- Simple language
- short/concise
- informal
- expression - lite
- less ad + adv
- no jargon, or immediately explained jargon

### Persuasive Style
- Flowery language
- emotive language
- jargon

### Paramedic method:
- circle the prepositions (of, in about, for onto, into)
- Draw a box around the "is" verb forms
- Ask, "Where's the action"
- Change the action into a simple verb
- Move the doer into the subject
- Eliminate any unnecessary slow wind-ups
- Eliminate any redundancies

#### Example:

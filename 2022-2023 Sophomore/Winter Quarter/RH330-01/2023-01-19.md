## Writing to learn vs writing to communicate

### Writing to learn:
- can be patch writing where there are lots of interleaved quotes/summaries with your thoughts and points weaved in
- Kind of like a brain storming session
- point is usually at the end
- concepts might meander

### Writing to Communicate
- Takes the patch writing and makes it audience oriented
- point is at the beginning
- concepts shift from old to new information
- leaps are guided and unpacked


## Activity
### Take 5 minutes to free write about anything

Road cycling, like any other endurance sport, is not for the faint of heart. It is physically demanding on a good day, bone-breaking and flesh-rending on a bad day, and usually leaves you sore after having a good race. However, the exhilaration of tearing down a mountain at breakneck speed,  feeling every imperfection in the road,  making the bike surge underneath you as you drive yourself forward, and working together as a team to go faster than any one person could, is what brings me and thousands of other people to the sport


Topic Sentences:
- The merits of road cycling

## Day 1 (First day was canceled)

### Syllabus Review
- Office is in F135
	- Masks Required in office
- Two highest tests are weighted 20%, worst is 15%
- **IMPORTANT:** In order to achieve a letter grade, the exam + final average must be within 5% of the HWK.
	- Basically, HWK can only bump your grade by 5%.
- No more than one column of problems per page on hwk
- Each weekday late for HWK is 20%
- **IMPORTANT**: Cite any and all sources that aren't the teacher or the textbook on homework.

### Multiplication and Addition Principles
#### Rule of Product/Multiplication Principle:
> Example: how many 2-character strings are there if the first character must be 1 or 2, and the second character must be *a , b* or *c*.

You find out what the choices are, then you multiply them. In the above example, there are 2 possible choices for character 1, and 3 possible choices for character 2.

#### Rule of Sum/Addition Principle

> Example: how many 2-character strings are there if both characters are letters **or** both are numbers? (Letters and numbers may be repeated.) (a,b,c,1,2)

Both Letters:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
	a & a\\  
	b & b \\
	c & c \\
	- & - \\
	3 & 3 & = 3^2 = 9
\end{array}
$$

Both Numbers:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
	1 & 1\\  
	2 & 2 \\
	- & - \\
	2 & 2 & = 2^2 = 4
\end{array}
$$

Therefore 13.

### Main Constructs:
lists $\equiv$ strings ORDER MATTERS!
1. Lists with repetition allowed
2. Lists with no repetition <span style='color: orange;'>permutations</span>
3. <span style='color: orange;'>Combinations</span>  with repetition
4. <span style='color: orange;'>Combinations</span> with unique elements $\leftarrow$ is the default for combinations

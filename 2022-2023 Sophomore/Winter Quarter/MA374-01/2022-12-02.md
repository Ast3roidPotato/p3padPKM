### What is a function

### Definition: Function
Left $f$ be a relation from $A$ to $B$. We call $f$ a *function* to mean that:
- *Formally:* $\forall A[\exists! b \in B[(a,b)\in f]]$
- *Informally:* for every element in the domain, there is exactly one arrow leading out from that element to the range

### Definition: Injective

-   _Formally:_$\forall x,y \in A[f(x) = f(y) \to x=y]$
-   _Informally:_ for every element in the range, there is at most one arrow leading into it.

> The term _one-to-one_ means the same thing as injective.

### Definition: Surjective

-   _Formally:_ $\forall y \in B, \exists x \in A[y = f(x)]$
-   _Informally:_ for every element in the range, there is at least one arrow leading into it.

> The term _onto_ means the same thing as surjective.

### Examples

>What is the number of injective functions form a set of size 4 to a set of size 7?

$$7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4 = \frac{7!}{3!}$$


> Determine the number of injective functions from the set $\{a,b,c,d\}$ to the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$

$$3\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4$$


> Determine the number of arrangements of length 5 from the set $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ if:
> - Repetition is allowed and the arrangement starts and ends with an even number


 $$5\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot5 = 10^3\cdot5^2$$
> - Repetition is *not* allowed and the arrangement starts and ends with an even number

 $$5\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot4 = \frac{8!}{3!}$$


> How many permutations of length 10 from the set $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ if all of the even digits are next to each other and all of the odd digits are next to each other.

$$2\cdot 5!$$

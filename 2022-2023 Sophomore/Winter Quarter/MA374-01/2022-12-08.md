## HWK Problem Question
Count paths from bottom to the top that don't go through a certain position. The best way to do it is to look at the paths through the no-go position and subtract from all possible paths. A good way to do this is to count the paths from the start to the no-go point, then count the paths from the no-go point to the end, and multiply them. Then subtract the result from the total search space.

## Counting Increasing Sequences
> How many strictly increasing sequences of 10 integers are that that start with 1 and end in 100? for example, one such sequence would be $1,2,10,22,45,76,78,90,99,100$

The answer is 98 choose 8.  $${98\choose8}$$

This is because, by choosing 8 unique numbers, you already know which order you are going to put them in, and the first and last digits are already chosen for you.


## Counting Cards
> Find the number of ways to get a full house with a five card poker hand. A full house is 3 of a kind with a pair.

## Combinations with Repetition
> Choose 6 objects from the set $\{a,b,c\}$ with repetition and order doesn't matter.

You transform this into a binary string problem. Use a "bars and stars" method.
When you see a letter, turn it into a * and when you see a change in letters, put a |. 

![[Drawing 2022-12-08 12.30.58.excalidraw|10000]]

You have number of choices - 1 dividers, and number of objects chosen stars. So you count the number of length 8 binary strings.

General form: $$\text{number of ways to choose}\;n\;\text{objects from}\;r\;\text{choices}$$$$ = {r+n-1\choose r}$$

General form: $$\text{number of ways to plcae}\;r\;\text{identical objects into}\;r\;\text{distinct containers}$$$$ = {r+n-1\choose r}$$

## Distinct objects into distinct containers
> Find the number of ways to distribute 8 numbered ping pong balls into 3 distinct containers.

This is a function problem mapping a set length 8 to a set length 3.
$$3^8$$


> Find the number of ways to distribute 8 *identical* ping pong balls into 3 distinct containers.

This is a combinations with repetition problem.

There are 3 objects (containers) to choose with 8 choices (balls)

$${8+3-1\choose 8} = {10\choose8}$$

> Find the number of ways to distribute 8 *identical* ping pong balls into 3 distinct containers with *no container left empty*

Place a single ball into each container first. This leave s you with 5 remaining balls. 
Place 5 identical balls into 3 distinct containers.

$${5+3-1\choose 5}$$

> Find the number of ways to distribute 10 identical red balls and 7 identical blue balls into 5 distinct containers, where every container has at least one red ball and the first container has no blue balls.

**Red balls:**
Place 1 red ball in each of the 5 containers, this leaves 5 red balls left.
n = 5, r = 5: $${5+5-1\choose 5} = {9\choose 5}$$
**Blue Balls:**
There can't be any blue balls in the first container.
r = 7, n = 4: $${7+3-1\choose 7} = {10\choose 7}$$ 

**Total:**
$${9\choose5}\cdot{10\choose7}$$

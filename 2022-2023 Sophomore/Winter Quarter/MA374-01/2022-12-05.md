## Circular Arrangements

### Examples

> Determine the number of ways to seat 3 people at a circular table where two seating's are considered the same if one can be rotated to the other


Methods to count:
- Group equivalent arrangements.
- Fix the location of the first person

> Determine the number of ways to seat 5 people around a circular table.

> Determine the number of ways to seat 5 people around a circular table if two of the people can't sit next to each other.

For a square table, you only can do 4 rotations. So the number of ways to seat people are $\frac{\text{permutations}}4.$


## More Lists - Lists with specified repetition

### Examples
> Determine the number of different arrangements of  $0,0,1$
>> This called a multiset

$$3$$ 

> Determine the number of different arrangements of $0,0,0,1$

$$4$$

> Determine the number of different arrangements of $00112345$

Lattice paths are lists with specified repetition. 

## Combinations

> Choosing objects from a set without repetition, and where the order of the objects doesn't matter. So you just care about which objects you choose, not the order.


### Formula
$$P(n,r) = \text{permutations} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
$$
{n \choose r} = \frac{P(n,r)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$

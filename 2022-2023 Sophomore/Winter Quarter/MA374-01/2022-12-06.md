## Facts about Binomial coefficients
$${n\choose r} = {n\choose n-r}$$

You can think of it like - the number of ways to choose something, is the same as the number of things that I am *not* choosing.


### Example

> find the number of arrangements of $0001111$ in two different ways.

$$\frac{7!}{3!4!} = {7\choose 3} = {7\choose 4}$$


7 Choose 3 is the way of thinking, I have 7 spots and I'm choosing the locations of the zeros. The ones have to be in the remaining spots. 7 choose 4 is saying that I have 7 spots and I'm choosing spots for the 1's. The zeros have to fill the remaining spots.


**Note**
> Counting the compliment (what you don't want) and subtracting from the total is sometimes easier than counting what you want directly be careful to make sure that you take out the *entire* compliment!

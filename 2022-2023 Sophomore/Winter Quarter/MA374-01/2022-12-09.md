## Probability
> Suppose you roll a 6-sided die 10 times.
> find the probability of rolling exactly two 1s.

Find the total possibilities:
$$6^{10}$$

**Find the target rolls:**
Choose the locations of 1's $${10\choose2}$$
Fill in the remaining positions positions:$$5^8$$
Total target: $${10\choose2}\cdot5^8$$

**Probability:** $$\frac{{10\choose2}\cdot5^8}{6^{10}}$$

## Pigeonhole Principle
> It you take $n+1$ pigeons and you have $n$ holes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.

Example:
> Show that any subset of size 6 from $\{1,2,3 ... 9\}$ must contain two elements whose sum is 10.

Since there are 4 pairs that sum to 10 and the extra 5, if we select 5 elements of S, we're guaranteed to select both elements of at least one of the pairs.

> While on a 4-week vacation, Luna plans to cast at least one spell per day, but no more than 40 spells total. Show that, no matter how Luna decides to cast her spells, there is a span of  consecutive days in which she will cast exactly 15 spells.

Let $x_L$ be the total # of spells on days $1,2 ... , i$ where $1\leq i\leq28$
$$1\leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq x_3 \leq x_3 ... x_{28} \leq 40$$

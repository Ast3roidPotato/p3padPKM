## Step Response of any order system:

### Time to Peak:
> Only Depends the imaginary part
Be sure to take into account that arc tan is periodic with period $\pi$.
$$T_p=\frac\pi{\omega_d}$$


### Percent Overshoot
> Only depends On the real part/the angle formed on the complex plot. The steeper the angle, the larger the overshoot.
- Big long equations - don't bother memorizing
### Settling Time
$$T_s = 4\tau\quad(2\%)$$

In an overdamped / damped system, the root that gives you the smallest settling time is the correct one. $\zeta$

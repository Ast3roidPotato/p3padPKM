## Day 1

### Syllabus Review

- 3 in class exams + a final
	- The first one is worth *half* of the points that the other two are.
	- This is because there are some things on the exam that some people can't believe are actually being tested on. 
	- People either do really well or really badly usually.
	- The 3 in class exams are *not* cumulative.
- HWK's are usually due Tuesday's at 4PM in the box in the ECE department.
	- Can be turned in up to 24hrs late for a 20% penalty.
	- Usually the answer is given/there is a way to check answers.
- LAB 
	- Each Person will turn in a separate lab.
	- It will be a worksheet that you fill in and turn into a Moodle drop-box.
	- Collaboration is encouraged. Sending code is <span style='color: red;'>not allowed.</span>
	- Labs must be turned by 5PM lab day, or turned in within 1 business day of the due date.
	- Lab can be done in advance, and if you don't have to show up to lab period if you *TURN IN THE LAB BEFORE THE LAB DATE.*
- Attendance
	- Does not take attendance - can leave if you want to do something else, but don't do anything but taking notes in class.

## REVIEW DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS!!!


## Lecture Start

We will mostly be using RLC circuits in this class, with op-amps tossed in at some point.

### Basic Models:
- Ideal Resistor: $v(t) = R\cdot i(t) \equiv [\text{volts}]=[\text{amps}][\text{ohms}]$
- Ideal Capacitor: $i_c(t) = c\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt} \equiv [\text{amps}] = \frac{[\text{farads}][\text{volts}]}{[\text{seconds}]}$
	- <span style='color: lightblue;'>if $v_c(t)$ is constant, then $i_c(t)=0$</span>
	- <span style='color: lightblue;'>if $v_c(t)$ is discontinuous, then $i_c(t)=\pm\infty$</span>
	- <span style='color: lightblue;'>Voltage across a capacitor *must be continuous*</span>
	- <span style='color: lightblue;'>For DC, caps are a break in the circuit</span>
- Ideal Inductor: $v_L(t) = L\cdot\frac{di_L(t)}{dt} \equiv [\text{volts}] = \frac{[\text{henrys}][\text{amps}]}{[\text{seconds}]}$
	- <span style='color: lightblue;'>if $i_L(t)$ is constant, then $v_L(t)=0$</span>
	- <span style='color: lightblue;'>if $i_L(t)$ is discontinuous, then $v_L(t)=\pm\infty$</span>
	- <span style='color: lightblue;'>Current through an inductor *must be continuous*</span>
	- <span style='color: lightblue;'>For DC, inductors are a short circuit</span>
### First Order (RLC) Circuits
A standard form for a first order circuit is:
$$\tau\frac{dy(t)}{dt} + y(t) = k\cdot x(t)$$
$$\tau\cdot\dot{y}(t) + y(t) = k\cdot x(t)$$
$$x(t) = \text{input}$$
$$y(t) = \text{output}$$
$$\tau = \text{time constant}$$
$$k = \text{static gain}$$

#### Static Gain

if $x(t) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}  
					A & t > 0\\  
					0 & t< 0  
				\end{array}  
		\right.\quad$ then $\tau\cdot\dot{y}(t)$ goes to zero. So then the output just is the input times the static gain.

#### Example
In general, for our circuits, the output will be $v_c(t)$ for capacitor circuits and $i_L(t)$ for inductor circuits. For first order circuits, there will only be one energy storage element (inductor *or* capacitor).

$$i_c(t) = \frac{V_s(t)-V_c(t)}{R} = c\frac{dV_c(t)}{dt}$$
$$Rc\frac{dV_c(t)}{dt} + V_c(t) = V_s(t)$$
$$\tau = RC, k=1$$

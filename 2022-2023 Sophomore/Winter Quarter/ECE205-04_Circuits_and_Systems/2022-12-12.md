## System Properties

Properties that can be used to characterize <u>any</u> system.
There is often a mathematical representation of the "system."


### Linear Systems
> A system possesses the scaling or <u>homogeneity</u> property.
$$\alpha x(t) \to \alpha y(t)$$
$$\alpha x(n) \to \alpha y(n)$$
>- Common Choices for $\alpha$ being 0, -1, 2
>
> A system possesses the <u>additive property</u>
>  $$x_1 \to y_1$$
>  $$x_2 \to y_2$$
>  $$\alpha_1x_1 + \alpha_2x_2 \to \alpha_1y_1+\alpha_2y_2$$

A linear system is any system that possesses both homogeneity and additivity.

#### Testing for Linear Systems
Assume $y(t) =  \mathcal{H}(x[n])$ is a system operator

It's important to conceptualize the problem as simply as possible. You have to know what you want and know that the solution that you want works all the time. Just going to code things works for everything <span style='color:orange'>BUT</span> concurrency problems. You should be *sure* that the solution will work properly on paper before moving to code. 

#### One solution for reader-writer problem
- Reader => barrier => add to a "batch" of readers
	- When the writer is finished writing, everyone in this "batch" of readers is let in to read and everyeone else who arrives is added to the next batch.
- Each thread who arrives is given a number and there are variables that keep track of how many readers are reading, and how many readers have finished reading. If the number of finished readers equals the batch size/cutoff, then the writers are woken up and can write again.

### Condition Variables

^TOC

#### Overview
- A condition variable is an explicit queue that threads can put themseles on when some state of exeution is not as desired
- Rather than <span style='color:brown'>spin-waiting</span> on a condition, a thread can put itself to sleep by waiting
- When another thread updates the condition, it can <span style='color:yellow'>signal</span> another thread to wake-up.
This is very effecient because the thread changing the state is also the one who currently has the CPU's 

#### API
```C
pthread_cond_t c;
pthread_mutex_t m;
pthread_mutex_init(&m,0);
pthread_cond_init(&c,0);

//Thing to call to change the state of the universe
pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *c); //template
pthread_cond_signal(&c);


//thing to call to detect change

pthread_cont_wait(pthread_cond_t *c, pthread_mutex_t *m);//template

pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
pthread_cont_wait(&c, pthread_mutex_t *m)
//you must have the mutex, it must be locked and the current thread must hold the lock
```

Multiple threads can be waiting on a condition variable.
If you use signal, one thread will wake up and move on.
If you use broadcast, *all* of the threads waiting will wake up and move on.

#### *Important*

Condition variable wait statements must be enclosed in a while loop.
```C
while (condition != met){
	pthread_cond_wait(&c,&m);
}
```

WHEN YOU CALL `pthread_cond_wait` the mutex passed in gets UNLOCKED! And *remains* unlocked while the thread is asleep. It then gets locked again when `pthread_cond_wait` returns.

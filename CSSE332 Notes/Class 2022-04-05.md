### Concurrent Programming

#### Threads VS Processes
- The only difference is what the OS decides it is
- Processes are seperate from each other and have seperate memory from eachother
- Threads are considered one process and have shared memory
- If you kill a child process, no related processes aren't killed
	- If a child process dies, nothing happens to the parent process
- If a thread seg-faults, all of them die

#### Intro to pthreads
pthreads stand for POSIX threads - IEEE 1003.1c

##### Compiling

MUST:
	Include pthreads header
```C
#include <pthreads.h>
```

must compile with ```-pthread``` flag

```c

void function(void *arg){
	int tid = *((int*) arg);
	printf("thread %d\n", tid);
	return NULL;
}

pthread_t thread; //thread structure
int i = 7;
pthread_create(&thread,NULL, function, &i); //thread creation
//if you want to pass more than one argument, use a struct

```

##### Waiting
Join is the pthread equivilent of wait. We use the `pthread_join()` function. 

```c
int* result;
pthread_join(thread, (void**)&result);
```

A thread can return a value either by doing a return or pthread_exit().

If don't ever join with a thread, you will <span style='color:red'>leak</span> an amount of resources

####  IMPORTANT
When you pass a parameter into a thread, THE VALUE CAN EASILY BE CHANGED AND THE THREAD PARAMETER WILL BE UPDATED!!!.

Therefore each thread parameter must have a "slot" for the params in an array.

If one thread messes up, everything in the program gets corrupted.

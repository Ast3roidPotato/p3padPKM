#### Producer Consumer Problem
The producer threads in some way create some data
Once they find the data, they don't want to deal with it themselves

The consumers use the data produced by the consumers

The problem occurs when the data is produced, but has not yet been consumed - and the data is just sitting there in memory. 
 - What if the producers outstrip the consumers?
	 - Producers stop producing when a buffer is full
		 - Bounded buffer problem
 - What if the consumers outpace the producers?
	 - Need to make sure that the consumers don't consume stuff that isn't valid data

Basically - the producers rest when the buffer is full and the consumers rest when the buffer is empty

It's better to have <span style='color:violet'>one</span> mutex and multiple condition variables.

Only signal/broadcast when wait cases are exited.

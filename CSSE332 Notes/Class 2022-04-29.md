### Memory Paging

#### Fragmention is a massive problem

#### Paging
Rather than divide memory into variable sized pieces, paging divided memory into memory <span style='color:orange'>frames</span>. Memory frames are chunks of a memory of a fixed size that store memory <span style='color:orange'>pages</span>. When a program mallocs some memory and doesn't already have a page, the OS will give that program a page and then internally map that variable to the page. This prevents system wide memory fragmentation, but doesn't prevent fragmentation within a page. When a program uses malloc more, it will allocate 

##### Address translation
- Page Number (P) is used as an index in a page taeltable which contains base addresses of each page in physical memory.
-  Page offset (D) - combined with the base address to define the physcal memory address that is sent the MMU (memory management unit)

So a physical memory address 0101, would represent an address in page 01 with offset 01.

To find the frame number, you look up the individual frame in the page table. The physical address in the example would be frame 6 offset 1 -> 11001

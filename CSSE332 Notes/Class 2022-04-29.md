### Memory Paging

#### Fragmention is a massive problem

#### Paging
Rather than divide memory into variable sized pieces, paging divided memory into memory <span style='color:orange'>frames</span>. Memory frames are chunks of a memory of a fixed size that store memory <span style='color:orange'>pages</span>. When a program mallocs some memory and doesn't already have a page, the OS will give that program a page and then internally map that variable to the page. This prevents system wide memory fragmentation, but doesn't prevent fragmentation within a page. When a program uses malloc more, it will allocate the memory in a programs existing page until it runs out of space, at which time it will give the program another page.

##### Address translation
- Page Number (P) is used as an index in a page taeltable which contains base addresses of each page in physical memory.
-  Page offset (D) - combined with the base address to define the physcal memory address that is sent the MMU (memory management unit)

So a physical memory address 0101, would represent an address in page 01 with offset 01.

To find the frame number, you look up the individual frame in the page table. The physical address in the example would be frame 6 offset 1 -> 11001

All of this paging is implemented on silicon, so paging *must have* hardware support. The OS doesn't do the grunt work of the paging system except for managing the pages. Oftentimes, a chip will support multiple different memory modes, but there is no OS level flexability other than that.

Each process must have its own page table. When an OS switches between processes, it switches a special register which contains the address of the program's unique page table. This enables each program to have it's own memory space that is "inaccessible" by other programs.

VPN = Virtual Page Number

##### Problems with Paging

- To do paging, there has to be a lookup in the page table, you need a memory lookup. This means that you have double the amount of memory lookups a program has to do.

32-bit machine with 4KB pages can have
- A million pages 
- 20 bits for VPN
- 12 bits for offset
- the page table is 4MB

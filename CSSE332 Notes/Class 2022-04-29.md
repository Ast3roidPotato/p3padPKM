### Memory Paging

#### Fragmention is a massive problem

#### Paging
Rather than divide memory into variable sized pieces, paging divided memory into memory <span style='color:orange'>frames</span>. Memory frames are chunks of a memory of a fixed size that store memory <span style='color:orange'>pages</span>. When a program mallocs some memory and doesn't already have a page, the OS will give that program a page and then internally map that variable to the page.

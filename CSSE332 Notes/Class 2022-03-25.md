"heres a bunch of rules... heres a bunch of bytes, i hope these bytes match these rules, but it looks like a bunch of garbage right now."-

One simple trick!

Make a structure with some cool metadata about the data

```c
struct cool_metadata-t mydata;
```


Say, at byte 1024, there is a superblock that describes what is in the filesystem. 

Make a structure that corresponds to EXACTLY what is supposed to be in that superblock. 32 bit integer, 64 bit integer, 8 bit integer... etc. Make everything the EXACT size that the spec says. That way, we take take the raw bytes

```c
struct cool_metadata-t mydata;
lseek(fd,1024,SEEK.SET); 
//SEEK.SET adjusts the read head to location at 1024
read(fd,mydata,sizeof(cool_metadata-t));
//This will fill the structure with the raw bytes in the metadata struct. Because the structure was designed to exactly conform to the spec, all of the bytes will fall into the correct spaces on the structure
```

Now, with this structure in place, you can just print the data like you normally would from a structure.

"If you do anything slightly wrong, your structures will be filled with trash data and it won't be obvious that there is something wrong but nothing will work properly."

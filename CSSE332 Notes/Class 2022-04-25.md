#### Virtual Addresses
The load and store assembly command addresses and C addresses aren't actual addresses in memory. All addresses that programmers see are *virtual addresses*

#### Simple Method
One simple method of hardware-based translation is the base and bonds method:
- The cpu has a base register which holds the starting point in pysical memory, and a bounds register which holds the ending point in physical memory.
- It checks the make sure that the memory addresses a program uses can't exceed the size of bounds.

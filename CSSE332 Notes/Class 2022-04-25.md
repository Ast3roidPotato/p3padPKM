#### Virtual Addresses
The load and store assembly command addresses and C addresses aren't actual addresses in memory. All addresses that programmers see are *virtual addresses*

#### Overview
Addresses that a program uses are virtual addresses that are translated into phyiscal, or real, addresses by hardware baked into the silicon. Virtualization allows for relocation of a programs memory.

This virtualization shold be invisable to any program, effecient, 

#### Simple Method
One simple method of hardware-based translation is the base and bonds method:
- The cpu has a base register which holds the starting point in pysical memory, and a bounds register which holds the ending point in physical memory.
- It checks the make sure that the memory addresses a program uses can't exceed the size of bounds. 
	- If the above is below the size of bounds, the physical address is base+virtual address
- The above only works if the program running can't access the base and bound registers.

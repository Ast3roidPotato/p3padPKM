#### Simple tracing garbage collection

Periodically or when memory is low...

1. Pause the eecution of out language
2. Start with a set of pointers that we call the "roots"
	1. These are cariales that are definitely accessible
	2. Includes the stacks of all threads
	3. Includes globals
3. For each accessile object
	1. Finds all objects that are accessible through the object's fields
	2. mark these objects as accessible
	3. Add these objects tothe list o objects to be searched
4. When this is done, free any unmarked objects

PROS:
- Never Frees something accessible
- Always frees everything unused
- No trouble with circular references

Cons
- Basically have to visit the entire memory space - SLOW
- Program is paused while this is happening
- Memory is fragmented

This is why languages like Java are subject to random long pauses - especially when it allocates alot of

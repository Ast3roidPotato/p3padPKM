^TOC

compile with `-ggdb` flag to save debug information

run => add configuration => ggdb for C/C++
- Change name to `<Program Name> Debug`
- Change `"program"= "$(fileDirname)/simpleshell"`
	- only works when simpleshell is open and in focus
- Change `"stopAtEntry"` to `true`
- After setupCommands add `miDebuggerPath: /usr/bin/gdb`

You have to add another configuration for each lab

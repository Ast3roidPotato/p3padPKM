### Malloc/Free Notes

```toc

``` 

^TOC

- You must free *everything* you malloc-ed. C wil not warn you about memory leakage
- You should check the return value of malloc to ensure it's not NULL
- You free by passing the same pointer to free that was originally returned from malloc
- The memory you malloc is initialized with garbage data
- Don't EVER access freed memory through it may still there 
- Freeing the same memory twice is unsafe
- Malloc is a rather expensive operation, so its better to allocate bigger chunks when possible


### Aside 
- The OS considers one page to be the smallest amount of memory size. One page might be around 4k bytes. C keeps track of the odd size chunks you malloc, and appropriately uses regions in a page to give you memory pointers. And mark whether something is free or used. Since C can only free a page when everything on that page is freed, the memory will only be freed when a large enough amount of memory is freed that C thinks there is enough space left. This means, that if you free a chunk of memory, most of the time, if you free memory, it isn't actually freed on the OS level, which means that the data that you put there is still there and you won't get a segmentation fault if you try to read or write to those addresses. You can still access this data, and most of the time, it will be fine **BUT** it can cause terrible bugs that will only appear "randomly."

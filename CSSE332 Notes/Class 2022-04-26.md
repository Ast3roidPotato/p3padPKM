*Never* reuse code for condition variable problems. Always start from scratch because the condition variable logic needs to be perfect.

Exam one Review - Has some good info: [[Class 2022-03-28]]

3 Problems of increasing difficulty, with the 3rd being around the difficulty of the easier condition variable 2 homework problems.

#### Skills Covered
- Thread creation - one question
	- Use threads to parallelize code - create/join
	- Passing parameters to threads - struct for multiple args
		- Make thread param arrays
	- Using mutexes
- Condition Variables & Mutexes - 2 questions
	- Mutex lock/unlokc
	- CV wait, signal, broadcast
	- Concurrent algorithms:
		- producer consumer
		- reader/writer
- CV Specific advice
	- ALWAYS ask if you do not understand what is correct and incorrect behavior
	- It's frequent that the output looks corect but there are still ocncurrency bugs
	- You *can* use sleeps to adjust timing to make concurrency bugs more evidenct a bit but *NEVER* rely on sleeps to make the code work - get rid of before submitting.
	- There's usually non reason to have more than one mutex - use "lock the world" strategy
